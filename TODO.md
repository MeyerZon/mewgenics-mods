# TODO — Mewgenics modding toolkit

Living status snapshot (last updated 2026-10-18). `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress · `[ ]` planned, not started.
Two agents were in flight at last update: Playwright E2E/validation and the SWF-loader-crash RE.

## Done

### Foundations
- [x] Review, validate (no injection, 0 vuln deps) and install REA from reviewed source (Docker-based)
- [x] Audit Mewjector source and build `version.dll` chainloader from source (clang-in-Docker)
- [x] Map the engine: build identity, RVAs, GON/overlay semantics, status model → `docs/engine-map.md`
- [x] Verify data-layer modding (`-modpaths`, `.append/.merge/.patch`) with a dev save suffix
- [x] Native framework `mewframework.dll` (build-gated, fail-closed) on Mewjector
- [x] Sample mod **Joker's Luck** (data + native status) — **verified in combat**
- [x] Save safety: permanent backup + `-savesuffix dev` isolation; main save sha256 `09a68a36…` unchanged

### Data-layer mod editor (`editor/`)
- [x] Core (single source of truth): GON parse/serialize (byte-faithful), overlay merge engine, schema, 4-check validator
- [x] Hand-rolled MCP stdio server (9 tools) — registered with Claude Code as `mewgenics-editor`
- [x] Local web UI (VanJS, vendored, zero runtime deps)
- [x] IDE-style UI redesign + onboarding (first-run tour, empty states, concepts drawer, worked example) — **PR #1 merged to `master`**
- [x] Design canvas (8 artboards: data editor + onboarding + the 3 Art-mode screens)

### Repo / docs / ops
- [x] Private GitHub repo `MeyerZon/mewgenics-mods` created + pushed
- [x] `README.md` landing page + `CLAUDE.md` guidance
- [x] Flag `tcrf.net/Mewgenics` as a do-not-fetch source (prompt injection) in `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Research: `docs/automation-feasibility.md`, `docs/art-pipeline.md`, `docs/swf-tooling-options.md`

### Art pipeline foundation (uncommitted WIP in working tree)
- [x] Hand-written SWF emitter (DefineShape + DefineSprite timelines + DefineBitsLossless2 PNG + optional stub DoABC)
- [x] SVG import, verification SWF reader, raw-WebGL in-game-faithful preview, Art-mode editor panels
- [x] Art-mode onboarding (dedicated art tour, empty states, concepts, worked example)
- [x] Performance pass: windowed GON highlighting on rAF, debounced + capped base explorer, preview loop suspends off-screen, play/pause bug fixed
- [x] `docs/art-preview-plan.md`; all of the above: typecheck clean, 77/77 unit tests pass

### Testing
- [x] **Playwright E2E suite** (`editor/tests/e2e/`, 33 tests) + real-browser validation — Data + Art flows + onboarding; `test:e2e` script; Chromium dev-only dep (user-authorized). typecheck + 77 unit + 33 e2e all green
- [x] **Fixed the real UI bug** the user was seeing: Art-mode Findings/Build tabs rendered JS source as literal text (VanJS binding returned a function into a child slot) — `editor/web/art-ui.mjs`

### Investigations run
- [x] DoABC/SymbolClass **gate test** on dev save → result: **DoABC is NOT the blocker**; our emitted SWF faults the `glaielswf` loader (new crash, distinct stack). Recorded.

## In progress

- [x] **SWF-loader crash RE** → `docs/swf-emitter-fix-spec.md` (final; 6 decompiles in `.analysis/decompiled/`). Crash is NOT a malformed SWF — it parses fine. Our clip merges into the live `AbilityIcon` sprite (`process_animation_merges` 0x9bc070); a **structurally-naive appended frame** triggers a post-load scripted call into the adventure-cutscene handler with no active run → null double-deref. `_Append_AbilityIcon` name CORRECT; **char-ID collision ruled out**. Method: static PE decoding + Ghidra (2nd attempt; 1st lost to memory contention from an orphaned container).

## Planned (not started)

### Next, directly queued
- [x] **Knowledge base** `docs/KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md` — what we know / what we don't / how to operate (indexes all deep-dive docs)
- [x] Docs consolidation pass — gate-test + SWF-crash findings folded into `engine-map.md` (new "Art / SWF subsystem" section) and `KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md`; Ghidra timeout-env gotcha + concurrency rules live in `engine-map.md`
- [x] Scrub tree for public — name + PC paths removed (see "Go public")
- [ ] Apply the emitter fixes from `swf-emitter-fix-spec.md` — LEADING: wrap the icon in a nested `DefineSprite` mirroring `AbilityIcon`'s per-frame structure (not a bare `DefineShape3`); default `abc:"none"`; keep FWS + `_Append_<name>`. Then one controlled in-game SWF re-test — *emitter frontier*
- [ ] Commit the uncommitted WIP (art pipeline + docs + `CLAUDE.md` flag) + open a PR for review (not merge)

### Go public (do LAST, after everything else lands — approved 2026-10-18)
- [x] Scrub complete: mod `author` → "MeyerZon"; test scratch path → env/`""`; save-backup doc path → `%USERPROFILE%`; `chainloader.ini` personal path → `__REPO__` placeholder resolved at install time; `build.bat`/`CLAUDE.md` toolchain path made `GCC`-env-overridable. (Tyler Glaiel's `__FILE__` asserts embedded in the game binary are RE evidence, kept.)
- [x] Fresh single clean commit under a public-safe identity (GitHub noreply email; no private session URL in the commit trailer)
- [x] New **public** repo created + pushed; verified clean history identity, tree grep = 0 for name tokens, nothing ignored/binary slipped in
- [x] Old private repo renamed + **archived** (not deleted — per user); its email-bearing history is retired

### Decisions pending
- [ ] Ruffle (WASM) dependency — only if we want to preview *vanilla* SWFs in-editor; would go through the skeptic dep-gate
- [ ] Dead key `mewged.onboard.conceptsDontShowStart` — the concepts drawer's "Don't show on start" button writes it but nothing reads it (concepts never auto-opens). Decide: wire concepts auto-open-on-start, or remove the button/key (recommend: remove the dead button)

### Larger build-out
- [ ] Animation-clip authoring workflow (DefineSprite timelines end-to-end) once the emitter is engine-valid
- [ ] Part-indexed **cat-rig** authoring UI (model already supports named layers)
- [ ] Emitter: gradient fills, LineStyle2, fonts/text, PlaceObject3
- [ ] MCP tools for art (so agents can author art, not just data)
- [ ] "Draw in VectorCraft →" SVG import handoff
- [ ] Testing frontier from `automation-feasibility.md`: AI-brain auto-resolve to smoke-test mods in a real fight (tiers B/C), eventually an IPC action layer (tier D)

### Open engine unknowns to resolve
- [ ] Exact SWF-format + `_Append_`/SymbolClass convention the loader requires (being answered by the RE agent)
- [ ] RNG seeding for deterministic test runs (no user-facing command found; would need our DLL or a fixed save)
- [ ] Headless / startup-macro mode (none found; closest is console + injected input or in-process DLL)
- [ ] Verify the INFERRED preview behaviors (nested-sprite framing, cxform-after-remap, engine fill rule, bitmap sampling)
- [ ] Per-build fragility: process to re-derive `bindings/` signatures when Mewgenics updates (framework fails closed meanwhile)
